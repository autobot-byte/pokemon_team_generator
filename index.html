		<h2>What is this and who are we?</h2>
		<p>The first question can be answered as a website that generates a hypothetical team</p>
		<p>And yes, the Pokemon were able to learn all of the moves at some point </p>
		<p>For this project we used the PokeAPI to gather all the data and blood, sweat, and tears during a 24 hour hackathon.</p>
		</br>
		<p>As for the second question, well we are a team of people who live in Denton. (map to be added later :P)</p>
